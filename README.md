Hi! My name is Josh Barrera-Torrez and I am currently a student getting a Bachelors in Computer Science with a major
in computer systems and a minor in mathematics.
I am very passionate when it comes to math but more so about calculus. I'd love to one day implement topics of
calculus into a personal project and post that here.
I have two and a half years of experience with C++ and half a year of C under my belt.
I am seeking to get an internship in the field of cybersecurity as one day I wish to become a cybersecurity analyst
defending our operating systems from external threats.
